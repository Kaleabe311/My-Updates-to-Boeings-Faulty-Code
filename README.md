# MCAS Safety Logic Simulator (Java)

This project is a beginner-level simulation of my updates to the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) used on the 737 MAX 8. Inspired by pseudocode generated by Perplexity AI, based on official reports from the 737 MAX crashes in 2019.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was built to simulate the code that should have been put in the 737 MAX 8s before being pushed out to pilots (at a very beginner level). It’s written in Java and is designed to:

- Take user input (flaps, flight mode, pilot input, AOA)
- Simulate MCAS activation based on conditions
- Output whether MCAS would activate or not

Some changes I made that Boeing did not have in their original MCAS code:
- Pilot input detection (MCAS will deactivate if pilot input is detected, giving the pilot ultimate control)
- To prevent a faulty AOA sensor from activating MCAS, it only accepts a plausible angle of attack (anything above 90 or below -90 is not accepted)


This is an original, beginner-level system built from scratch using real-world logic and refined with AI support. The program takes in information of the plane from user-entered true/false, which is meant to mimic the computer being able to receive data from the plane. I hope to make the means of data gathering more professional as I learn more coding.
